
# ANN-Based Customer Prediction Model

This project demonstrates the creation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for predicting customer behavior using a dataset of 10,000 bank customers. The dataset contains various features related to the customers' demographics and financial information. The goal is to predict a target outcome (e.g., churn or retention) based on these features.

## Project Overview
This project utilizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to analyze a bank's customer dataset and make predictions about customer behavior. The ANN was built using the TensorFlow/Keras library and trained on features such as credit score, age, account balance, and other customer-related attributes.

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains information on 10,000 customers of a bank with the following features:

- **CreditScore**: The customer’s credit score.
- **Geography**: The country where the customer is based.
- **Gender**: Male or Female.
- **Age**: The customer’s age.
- **Tenure**: Number of years the customer has been with the bank.
- **Balance**: The customer's bank balance.
- **NumOfProducts**: Number of products the customer has with the bank.
- **HasCrCard**: Does the customer have a credit card? (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **IsActiveMember**: Is the customer an active member? (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **EstimatedSalary**: The customer’s estimated salary.

## Model Architecture
The ANN model was built using the following architecture:

- **Input Layer**: 10 input features.
- **Hidden Layers**: 
  - Fully connected layers with activation functions (e.g., ReLU).
  - Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
- **Output Layer**: Binary output for prediction (or softmax for multi-class predictions).

The model was trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss for binary classification problems.

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MuhamadMursaleen/-ANN-Based-Customer-Prediction-Model.git
cd -ANN-Based-Customer-Prediction-Model
```

### Step 2: Create a virtual environment
It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

For **Python 3**:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
- On **Windows**:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On **macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### Step 3: Install dependencies
Once the environment is activated, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Verify the installation
Ensure that all required packages are installed by running:
```bash
python --version
pip freeze
```

## Running the Project

### Step 1: Prepare the dataset
Place the `bank_customers.csv` dataset file in the root directory of the project.

### Step 2: Train the model
To train the ANN model using the provided dataset, run the following command:
```bash
python train_model.py
```

### Step 3: Make predictions
Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new customer data:
```bash
python predict.py --input customer_data.csv
```

The script will output the predictions for the new customer data.


## Future Work
- Enhance the model's architecture to improve accuracy.
- Experiment with other algorithms like Random Forest or XGBoost for comparison.
- Implement hyperparameter tuning.
- Add more detailed feature engineering.
